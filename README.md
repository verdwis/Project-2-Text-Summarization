# Project-2-Text-Summarization

This project aims to develop a text summarization system using the cahya/bert-base-indonesian-522M Transformer model on a dataset collected from Liputan 6 news sources. Text summarization technology can process and summarize long texts automatically, so it can help users to get important information quickly and efficiently.
